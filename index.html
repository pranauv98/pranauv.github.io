        <p class="about">
            Hi there, I am an AI Engineer specializing in designing large-scale Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, intelligent document-processing pipelines, and high-performance search architectures. My work centers around integrating LLMs (GPT, Gemini), vector search engines (Vespa), and cloud-native infrastructures (AWS Lambda, S3, Athena) to build production-ready solutions for financial document analysis. I architect and deploy end-to-end NLP pipelines involving hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse), embedding generation, prompt-driven extraction logic, and transformer-based classifiers. I have built binary and multiclass classification models using DSPy, Hugging Face Transformers, and PyTorch—achieving 80%+ accuracy and automating complex decision workflows across thousands of documents.
        </p>
        <p class="about">
            My approach combines software engineering best practices—clean architecture, modular design, CI/CD principles—with strong ML fundamentals to build reliable, traceable, and maintainable AI systems. I’m deeply interested in advancing retrieval pipelines, evaluation frameworks, and LLM-powered automation for enterprise-scale document intelligence.<br><br>
